Easily add category buttons to link to their respective category page, with the post count added to the button. 

== Description ==
This plugin requires Elementor currently, to be able to function as designed. Use the drag and drop builder to place buttons and then choose from the dynamic list of categories to quickly create a button. Use custom editing features just like with any other Elementor widget.

== Installation ==
Download and Activate Elementor.
